This could happen because it couldn't find or read the files (error dialog), or because Pygame isn't installed (console message). Pygame is the module that handles the game's audio. It could be absent if you're running Chess from source code and haven't installed Pygame, or if you're running Chess from the bundled package and deleted the Pygame module for some reason. If you don't provide Chess with a valid custom sound folder, and the default folder doesn't work either (not all files are valid and present, or you don't have read permission for that folder), it won't be able to load audio. To fix the problem indicated by this error message, ensure that Chess can access some kind of valid sound folder (either by specifying a custom folder or by closing Chess, repairing access to the default folder, and restarting Chess), and ensure that Pygame is installed.</span></p>

First, make sure you're not using green, dark green, blue, or dark blue squares, as the highlighting won't be visible on top of its own color. Second, make sure that the piece icons you're using contain transparency somewhere - piece icons will expand to fill an entire square, so icons with no transparent areas will block their entire square and you won't see highlighting.</span></p>

If your GIF file was made with a program that intelligently leaves undrawn any identical portions between frames (to save space or improve performance), those areas will not be rendered properly in Chess, as Chess's GIF animation style displays each frame independently instead of drawing them one on top of another.</span></p>
